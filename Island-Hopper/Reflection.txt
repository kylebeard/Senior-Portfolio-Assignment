This was a semester-long project done in Software Engineering. I worked with 3 other people, and since it was such a big project split amongst 4 of us, we really had to learn how to effectively communicate and also how to use Github. It was a tough project, pretty much starting from nothing, we had to research and choose our own tech stack, then learn how to use all of the technologies since almost everything was new to us. Unfortunately I can't get this project to run, it has 29 security issues found by Github and our dependencies are now 3 years old; but I still think it has value, it was a big project that we wrote from the ground up, we werent given a skeleton of the project to fill in, we had to decide on the structure of the app ourselves which was challenging.
