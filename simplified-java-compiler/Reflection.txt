Simplified Java Compiler Reflection

This was an awesome project. As the name implies it's a compiler for a subset of the Java language. 
It implements many of the core features, like classes, methods, variables, if-statements, switch-statements, 
for/while/do-while loops and more. However, it doesn't implement the full Java language; for example, 
it doesn't implement generics. 

I chose it because it's just really cool to peek behind the curtains and see a little bit of how programming languages 
are actually constructed and translated to (in this case) JVM code. You can be a good application developer without ever 
knowing how your programs are translated into executable machine code; but since high-level programming languages 
are used almost everywhere, it's great to have some knowledge about how they work.
